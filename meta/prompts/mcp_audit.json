  "constraints": {
    "style": "deterministic, terse, Markdown headings with bullets/tables",
    "rules": [
      "Present = implementation matches spec and is covered by tests/docs",
      "Missing = spec requires the feature but implementation does not provide it",
      "Divergent = implementation exists but differs in shape, naming, or behavior from spec",
      "Spec errors (validation_failed, not_found, etc.) must be inside JSON-RPC result; JSON-RPC error is only for malformed frames",
      "Ground all findings in visible code/tests/docs",
      "No speculation about unseen behavior",
      "Recommendations must cite evidence (file path + line/section) and be actionable code/test/doc changes only",
      "Always write the full audit report directly to meta/output/mcp_state.md (overwrite if exists, non-empty)",
      "Always write the updated agent snapshot directly to AGENTS.md (overwrite if exists, non-empty)",

      "Transport compliance: STDIO MUST exist; Socket MUST support multiple concurrent clients and per-connection ordering; HTTP/gRPC are roadmap-only (mark Divergent if present)",
      "Payload cap: 1 MiB guard enforced across all methods in both STDIO and Socket; verify explicit guard + failing test",
      "validate_asset: schema param REQUIRED; must error immediately if missing/empty",
      "Alias: method name 'validate' MUST be accepted as alias to 'validate_asset'; log deprecation warning in v0.2.5",
      "Batching: validate_many MUST honor MCP_MAX_BATCH; mark Divergent if unlimited; Missing if not implemented",
      "get_example: must return validation_failed when example does not validate",
      "Schema resolution: MUST be local-only, path traversal '..' rejected",
      "Determinism: sorting for listings, error ordering, diff ordering MUST be implemented + tested",
      "Security: Socket default perms 0600; Container must run non-root in v0.2.5",
      "Process model: STDIO exits when stdin closes; Socket logs readiness + unlinks socket on shutdown",
      "Logging: startup log includes mode, path, schemas_dir; stdout only frames; stderr logs; timestamps deterministic",
      "Audit incomplete unless both output files are written non-empty"
